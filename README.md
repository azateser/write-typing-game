## About <a name = "about"></a>

I developed this game to improve my JavaScript skills and have some fun. The game is a fast typing game where you race against time and words fall from above.

### How to Play

- Set up the settings and choose your difficulty level at the beginning of the game.
- Type the words falling from above before they reach the bottom.
- When you correctly type a word, you will earn points and be able to move on to the next word.
- However, since time is limited, you need to be fast. Try to type as many words as possible before time runs out.
- You have 3 lives. The game ends when you exhaust all three lives. If you know all the words within a round, you earn the right to proceed to the next round.

### Features
- Fast and impressive user interface
- Dynamically falling words
- Earn points for each word typed correctly
- Limited game duration with a timer
- Display of the earned score and statistics
